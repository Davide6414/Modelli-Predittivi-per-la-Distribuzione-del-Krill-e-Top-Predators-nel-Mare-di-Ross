        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Over the past two centuries, human exploitation and climate change have caused significant shifts in Antarctic marine biodiversity. Krill, a fundamental component of the marine food web, serves as a crucial ecological indicator.</p>
        <p>Environmental descriptors such as water temperature, salinity, ice cover, and nutrient availability, along with species interactions, are key factors influencing organism distribution. Machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) effectively predict distributions based on the ecological niche concept. These models have shown promising results in the Ross Sea, particularly for phytoplankton and zooplankton (Pinkerton et al., 2010; Grillo et al., 2022).

            This thesis aims to develop predictive distribution models for Antarctic krill and top predators using historical data from the X Italian Expedition to the Ross Sea (November–December 1994). The data, classified as "grey literature," will provide a baseline for comparison with present conditions. Both fundamental niche factors (e.g., temperature, salinity, ice cover) and realized niche elements (e.g., competition, predation) will be included in the models to better understand species distribution, as interactions with other organisms can limit access to suitable habitats.
            
            Multiple RF models will be trained for each species and compared across three different methodologies to identify the most reliable approach. The best-performing model will then be applied to new environmental data covering the Ross Sea area to create heatmaps illustrating species presence probabilities on a broader scale. These maps will allow for the assessment of whether predicted distributions are influenced by environmental factors, prey-predator dynamics, or competitive interactions, offering insights into the biogeography and ecological dynamics of the Antarctic environment.

            <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
            <p>The study implemented a pipeline for collecting environmental data directly using R, with input from raster files downloaded from Quantarctica. Multiple models were trained to identify the best-performing ones for both fundamental and realized niches.</p>
        
            <img src="pipeline.png" alt="Pipeline Overview" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:10px;">
        
            <h3>Workflow Overview: Species Distribution Modeling</h3>
        
            <h4>1. Data Conversion</h4>
            <p>The raw data is first processed to classify observations into <strong>presence</strong> (red) and <strong>absence</strong> (blue) categories, forming the basis for model training.</p>
        
            <h4>2. Training Matrix Construction</h4>
            <p>Environmental variables such as <strong>iron, silicate, salinity, chlorophyll, surface currents, and ice cover</strong> are compiled into a structured matrix. The dataset is split into <strong>70% for training</strong> and <strong>30% for validation</strong>, ensuring a balanced approach for model optimization.</p>
        
            <h4>3. Model Training and Selection</h4>
            <p>Three machine learning models are trained using the dataset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Model</strong> – baseline performance</li>
                <li><strong>Optimized Model</strong> – fine-tuned for improved accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Model</strong> – to identify the most relevant variables and remove background noise.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>4. Application to New Data</h4>
            <p>The trained models are tested on unseen environmental datasets to assess their predictive accuracy. Predictions fall into three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High performance & reliability</strong> (best models)</li>
                <li><strong>Good performance but lower reliability</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Lower overall performance</strong></li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>5. Heatmap Construction</h4>
            <p>The output predictions are visualized as <strong>heatmaps</strong>, where different colors indicate the <strong>relative occurrence index</strong> (0 to 1), with higher values reflecting a greater probability of species presence.</p>
        
            <h4>6. Incorporating Realized Niche Data</h4>
            <p>To refine predictions, the models integrate species distribution data beyond environmental variables, incorporating <strong>biotic interactions</strong> such as competition and predation. This step helps distinguish between <strong>potential</strong> and <strong>realized</strong> habitats.</p>
        
            <h4>7. Model Evaluation Metrics</h4>
            <p>Model performance is assessed using four key statistical measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> – overall correctness of predictions</li>
                <li><strong>AUC-ROC</strong> – ability to differentiate between presence and absence</li>
                <li><strong>TSS (True Skill Statistic)</strong> – measures predictive power beyond random chance</li>
                <li><strong>Kappa</strong> – agreement between predicted and observed distributions</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>8. Realized Niche Concept</h4>
            <p>The final distribution maps reflect the <strong>realized niche</strong>, i.e., the portion of the fundamental niche <strong>actually occupied</strong> by the species under natural conditions, considering the influence of other organisms and ecological interactions.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            The use of machine learning to model the distribution of marine organisms has proven highly effective, 
            providing accurate predictions across a wide range of species, from small organisms to apex predators. 
            Some predictions have been validated using historical data, such as the migrations of Adélie penguins 
            and krill distributions. The modeling of large mammals, such as orcas, has shown results consistent 
            with their ecology, despite validation challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, modeling all key species was not possible due to limited data availability. With more comprehensive 
            datasets, it could be possible to reconstruct the entire Antarctic trophic network. Open data sharing, in 
            accordance with FAIR principles, is crucial to improving model performance. Additionally, a reproducible 
            pipeline has been developed to optimize environmental data retrieval and analysis. This approach could be 
            expanded with open-source software, making machine learning techniques more accessible to the scientific 
            community.

                        <p>The predicted distribution based on the realized niche  shows an increased probability of krill occurrence in two specific areas: east of the Ross Sea, at the northernmost edge of the MPA dedicated to krill research (KRZ), and in the Ross Gyre region. While this pattern is clearly visible, it appears as an underestimation in the image, and its causes remain uncertain. Additionally, there is a significant decrease in krill occurrence probability in offshore areas, with IOR values approaching zero. This phenomenon seems linked to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which strongly influences environmental descriptors and significantly impacts krill distribution in this region (Hense et al., 2003).

These regions are likely associated with greater food availability and proximity to breeding colonies, consistent with the species' ecology, which requires nesting on land (Emslie et al., 2014). In contrast, areas far from the coast or in open ocean show significantly lower IOR values, averaging 0.4%, reflecting reduced environmental suitability for the species.
